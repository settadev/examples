# Examples

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained [Setta](https://github.com/settadev/setta) project.

First, clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/settadev/examples.git
cd examples
```

Then go into one of the directories. For example:
```
cd stream_diffusion_img_to_img
```

Follow the installation instructions in that folder's readme. Usually it's a single command like `. ./install.sh`.

Then start Setta:
```

```
And go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.
