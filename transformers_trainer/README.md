# Configuring Transformers

In this example, we configure many of the inputs to the `transformers.Trainer` object, including the model, dataset, tokenizer, and evaluation method.

## Install packages

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start Setta

Run this in your terminal:

```
setta
```

Then in your browser go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## The Simplified UI

The default project is a simplified UI and should look like this:

As you can see, much of the configuration is hidden from view in the minimized sections. 

If you'd prefer to see all those details, you can go to the left-side projects pane, and click on `transformers_trainer_dev`.
