## Chatting with Llama 3

Enter your Groq API key in the `Global Variables` section. Make sure it's in quotes. 

For example if your API key is `123` then you should enter `"123"`

Click Run in the nav bar. 

That's it! You can start chatting with Llama 3.

Note: when you save this project, the API key will not be saved to the `setta.db` file. Instead, a json file named `secrets.json` will be created in the examples folder. This json file will contain the API key you entered in `Global Variables`. So next time you start `setta`, it will read the API key from that file.
